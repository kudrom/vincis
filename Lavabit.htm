				<p>My Fellow Users,</p>
				<p>I have been forced to make a difficult decision: to become 
complicit in crimes against the American people or walk away from nearly
 ten years of hard work by shutting down Lavabit. After significant soul
 searching, I have decided to suspend operations. I wish that I could 
legally share with you the events that led to my decision. I cannot. I 
feel you deserve to know what’s going on--the first amendment is 
supposed to guarantee me the freedom to speak out in situations like 
this. Unfortunately, Congress has passed laws that say otherwise. As 
things currently stand, I cannot share my experiences over the last six 
weeks, even though I have twice made the appropriate requests.</p>
				<p>What’s going to happen now? We’ve already started preparing the 
paperwork needed to continue to fight for the Constitution in the Fourth
 Circuit Court of Appeals. A favorable decision would allow me resurrect
 Lavabit as an American company.</p>
				<p>This experience has taught me one very important lesson: without 
congressional action or a strong judicial precedent, I would _strongly_ 
recommend against anyone trusting their private data to a company with 
physical ties to the United States.</p>
				<p>Sincerely,<br>Ladar Levison<br>Owner and Operator, Lavabit LLC</p>
				<p>Defending the constitution is expensive! Help us by donating to the Lavabit Legal Defense Fund <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=7BCR4A5W9PNN4">here</a>.</p>
